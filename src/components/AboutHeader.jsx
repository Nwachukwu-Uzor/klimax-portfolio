            For the past 6 years, I've worked as a Multidisciplinary Designer
            and Product Designer, including 2 years as a Product Designer for
            NGO's and African businesses and startups â€“ (Financial technology,
            Edtech, Crypto Startups, Social Networks and developmental
            organisations). I have also collaborated with major industry class
            designers both locally and international as collaboration is key to
            giving out the best of qualities.

            I am capable of operating as a one-person design firm and treating
            my clients as creative collaborators. So I'm more than simply a
            product designer or a project manager; I'm a design entrepreneur who
            appreciates the faith that clients invest in me. Digital products
            and digital brand experiences, as well as user interfaces and
            experiences, are among my key interests.
